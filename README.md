# Benjamin Bella's Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way for people to contact me.

The website is a static site built with HTML and CSS. It is fully responsive and should work on all devices.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the website. The site uses custom CSS for all styling and layout, including flexbox for responsive design.
*   **Google Fonts:** The "Poppins" font is used for the typography.

## How to Use

To view the website, you can either:

1.  **Clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Benjabella/Benjabella.github.io.git
    cd Benjabella.github.io
    # Open index.html in your favorite browser
    ```

### GitHub Pages

This portfolio is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. Since the repository is named `Benjabella.github.io`, the website will be automatically deployed when you push to the `main` branch.

Your live portfolio will be available at [https://Benjabella.github.io](https://Benjabella.github.io).
